subject: Company-wide Christmas apparel tomorrow
content:  I just got notice from our CMO that we’ll be filming for the company Holiday greeting video tomorrow. All employees are expected to appear in the video, so please wear red and green and any other holiday apparel you own (Santa suits, Christmas sweaters, reindeer noses, and onesies encouraged).

subject: New office policy
content: This has been a particularly bad flu season, and we’re concerned about how disease affects productivity. After much discussion and review of recent research, leadership has decided to issue an office policy against sneezing. If you need to sneeze, please go to the bathroom to avoid spreading germs and wash your hands after the sneeze. Do not sneeze at your desk! This new policy starts tomorrow.

subject: Help me keep my eyes well!
content:  After several years of getting increasingly bad eyes and stronger prescriptions, I’ve finally gotten a diagnosis. My optometrist informed me that I have a condition in which the color black is damaging my eyesight, sort of like an allergy. I’ll be wearing shaded glasses for the next couple of weeks while I undergo treatment. Please refrain from using black on any team documents or presentations (bright colors are okay).
